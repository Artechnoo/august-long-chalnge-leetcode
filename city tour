There are A cities numbered from 1 to A. You have already visited M cities, the indices of which are given in an array B of M integers.

If a city with index i is visited, you can visit either the city with index i-1 (i >= 2) or the city with index i+1 (i < A) if they are not already visited.
Eg: if N = 5 and array M consists of [3, 4], then in the first level of moves, you can either visit 2 or 5.

You keep visiting cities in this fashion until all the cities are not visited.
Find the number of ways in which you can visit all the cities modulo 10^9+7.

Input Format


The 1st argument given is an integer A, i.e total number of cities.
The 2nd argument given is an integer array B, where B[i] denotes ith city you already visited.
Output Format

Return an Integer X % (1e9 + 7), number of ways in which you can visit all the cities.
Constraints

1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= M <= A
1 <= B[i] <= A
For Example

Input:
    A = 5
    B = [2, 5]
Output:
    6
   
Explanation:
    All possible ways to visit remaining cities are :
    1. 1 -> 3 -> 4
    2. 1 -> 4 -> 3
    3. 3 -> 1 -> 4
    4. 3 -> 4 -> 1
    5. 4 -> 1 -> 3
    6. 4 -> 3 -> 1












solution:


MOD = int(1e9 + 7)
MAX_N = 1000 + 5
# following creates an unexpected problem, reference of inner array is copied
# comb = [[0]*MAX_N]*MAX_N
comb = [[0]*MAX_N for _ in range(MAX_N)]
for n in range(MAX_N):
    comb[n][0] = 1

for n in range(1, MAX_N):
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        comb[n][r] = (comb[n-1][r] + comb[n-1][r-1]) % MOD

powers_of_two = [1]
for i in range(1, MAX_N):
    powers_of_two.append((powers_of_two[-1]*2) % MOD)

        # Calculate for the first range, it's numbers can be ordered among themselves in only one way
        # But we can take diff = B - A[-1] from current_total+diff in (current_total+diff)C(diff) ways
        if B[-1] < A:
            diff = A - B[-1]
